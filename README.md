##Introduction
The Memory Game is required project for Udacity's Front-End Development Nanodegree.

Though starter code was provided, I tried as much as possible to build completely from scratch using the starter code only as a guide.

##Objective
The object of the Memory Game is to match all eight pairs of cards in the fewest moves possible.

##How it Works
Each move, the player uncovers two cards to see if their symbols match. If the cards match, they stay open. If the cards do not match, the cards flip back over.

During gameplay, the player's star rating will decrease based on the number of moves they make.

The game is won when all 16 cards are uncovered. A modal will display with the players final score -- their star rating, the number of moves it took to win, and how long it took to win.
